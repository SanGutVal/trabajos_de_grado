The methodology focuses on analyzing the displacement of interferometric fringe patterns through an experimental scheme based on a Michelson interferometer. The resulting experiment data are acquired using a temporal sensor. Subsequently, a digital processing of these data is conducted to characterize the disturbances inherent to the standard operation of a laser beam cavity. This data analysis allows for identification and characterization of any anomalies that may arise during the laser beam propagation. This methodological approach, combining experimental instrumentation with data analysis techniques and digital processing, lays the groundwork for design and implementation of control and stabilization strategies.

The research culminates in the development of a robust method for analyzing the spatiotemporal displacement of interferometric fringes. This approach represents an improving in control and stabilization strategies, by providing a reliable approach to assess and mitigate the effects of temporal disturbances on interferometric systems, opening new opportunities for the design and development of affordable electro-optical systems.
